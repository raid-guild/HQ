# Methodology for for Internal Projects.

We should keep a registry of internal projects that we as a Guild would like to work on.

### Is a full Raid Party Needed?

For small tasks where just one Member can handle it, a Proposal can be submitted directly to the Member through the dao.
For larger tasks where a team is needed, normal Raid Party methodology should be followed.

1. Form Raid Party
2. Summon Multisig
3. Submit proposal to the Dao (with funds going direct to the Raid Party's Multisig)
